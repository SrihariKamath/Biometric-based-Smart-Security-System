    <p>Although the central theme of the project is pretty straightforward, we’ve identified certain key areas that make it stand out. With the combination of several team members all of whom bring different viewpoints and skills to the table, we’ve implemented several techniques that enable the project to have some exciting features.</p>

        <h2>Budget Friendly</h2>
        <p>Right from the cost of implementation to that of maintenance, keeping the system as cost effective as possible was a constant focus. Not only is it simple to implement, but also requires minimal skills to operate.

      <div class='service-item two'>
       <div class='icon'><img src="https://img.icons8.com/external-justicon-flat-justicon/100/000000/external-doctor-hospital-and-medical-justicon-flat-justicon.png"/> </div> 
        <h2>User’s best friend</h2>
        <p>While it is practically impossible for a human, or even a group of them, to keep both a proper set of passwords, while also remembering them, biometrics are the passkeys you carry with you always. </p>
        </div>

       <div class='service-item three'>
       <div class='icon'><img src="https://img.icons8.com/external-kiranshastry-lineal-color-kiranshastry/100/000000/external-chain-automobile-kiranshastry-lineal-color-kiranshastry.png"/> </div> 
        <h2>Impossible the chain</h2>
        <p>If lets say a person A is somehow manages to get a copy of your fingerprints, the three level security will still prevent the user from accessing your records or account. </p>
        </p>
        </div>

     <div class='service-item four'>
       <div class='icon'><img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/100/000000/multicast.png"/> </div>
        <h2>Beyond just security</h2>
        <p>With little to no adjustments to the underlying code, we can use this system to other applications. One common example is a smart home security system which takes commands from different members in the same family.</p>
